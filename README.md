Got it. You want a simpler, more human-readable format that integrates the capabilities directly into the workflow description. I've removed the tree structure and combined the process and capabilities sections into a single, easy-to-follow guide.

Here is the final revised `README.md`.

# Layered Agent Workflow for VS Code Copilot

This repository contains a structured, multi-agent workflow for software development using custom VS Code Copilot chat modes and reusable prompts. It establishes a clear, layered process that enhances agent performance through deliberate **Context Engineering**.

## Core Philosophy: Context Engineering

The primary goal of this workflow is to manage the LLM's context window effectively. By dividing the development process into distinct phases‚Äî**Research**, **Planning**, and **Implementation**‚Äîwe practice **Context Engineering**. This ensures that each agent receives a tailored, minimal context sufficient only for its specific job. This results in more reliable, efficient, and predictable outcomes from the AI agents.

## The Agents & Their Roles

This system is built around three specialized agents (chat modes):

  * **üßë‚Äçüî¨ The Researcher:** The information gatherer. Its job is to explore the codebase, search external documentation, and synthesize all relevant information into a foundational `RESEARCH.md` document.
  * **üìù The Planner:** The strategist. It takes the curated research and, through a collaborative process with the user, breaks it down into a high-level `PLAN.md` and a series of discrete, actionable tasks.
  * **üõ†Ô∏è The Implementer:** The executor. A "worker bee" that takes a single task file and executes the instructions precisely as written, without deviation.

-----

## Workflow Steps

The process is divided into two main phases, moving from human-led direction to automated agent execution.

### Phase 1: Human-Led Interaction

1.  **Goal Definition (User)**
    *   The process begins when the user provides a high-level development goal.

2.  **Research (üßë‚Äçüî¨ Researcher Agent)**
    *   The user and the **Researcher** collaborate to explore the codebase, gather requirements, and analyze dependencies.
    *   **Handoff:** The agent produces a `/tmp/RESEARCH.md` file for user review and approval.

3.  **Planning (üìù Planner Agent)**
    *   The user provides the approved `RESEARCH.md` to the **Planner**.
    *   Through a collaborative dialogue, they create a high-level strategy and break it down into discrete, actionable tasks.
    *   **Handoff:** The agent produces:
        *   A `/tmp/PLAN.md` file outlining the overall strategy.
        *   One or more task files (e.g., `/tmp/TASK_01.md`, `/tmp/TASK_02.md`).

### Phase 2: Agent-Led Execution

4.  **Implementation (üõ†Ô∏è Implementer Agent)**
    *   The **Implementer** receives a single task file (e.g., `/tmp/TASK_01.md`) and executes the required code changes.

5.  **Verification & Reporting**
    *   The implemented changes are verified.
    *   **On Success:** A **Completion Report** is generated.
    *   **On Failure:** A **Failure Report** is generated, detailing the errors.

6.  **Iteration Loop**
    *   In case of a failure, the **Failure Report** is escalated back to the **Planner**, allowing the user to revise the plan and generate a new task file.

## The Workflow in Action

Here is the intended step-by-step process, from initial idea to final implementation.

### 1\. The Research Phase

Your journey begins with the **üßë‚Äçüî¨ Researcher**. Activate it in the chat (`@workspace #research`) and use the `/start-research` command to begin a scripted dialogue where you provide the project requirements. Once the agent has enough information, instruct it to begin its investigation. To conclude this phase, use the `/create-research-document` command, which will guide the agent to produce the final `/tmp/RESEARCH.md` file for your review.

### 2\. The Planning Phase

With the research complete, switch to the **üìù Planner** (`@workspace #plan`). Use the `/create-plan` command and point it to the `RESEARCH.md` file. You will first approve a high-level strategy and then collaboratively define each specific implementation task. This process results in a `/tmp/PLAN.md` and one or more `/tmp/TASK_XX_description.md` files.

### 3\. The Implementation Phase

Now, switch to the **üõ†Ô∏è Implementer** (`@workspace #implement`). Assign a single task using the `/implement-prompt` command and provide the path to a task file (e.g., `/tmp/TASK_01_description.md`). The agent will confirm its understanding before proceeding. After executing the task, it will use the `/report-status` command to inform you of its success or failure.

### 4\. Handling Problems and Sessions

  * **Revising a Plan:** If the Implementer reports a failure, take its detailed error report back to the **Planner**. Use the `/revise-plan` command to collaboratively debug the issue and generate a corrected task file. The Implementer can then be given the new instructions using the `/reconcile-plan` command.
  * **Saving Your Work:** At the end of a session with the Researcher or Planner, use the `/summarize-session` command. This creates a permanent, traceable summary of your work linked to issue trackers.
  * **Managing Long Conversations:** If a chat thread grows too long and agent performance degrades, use the `/thread-dump` command to generate a concise handoff briefing. You can then paste this into a new chat session to continue your work with a fresh context.
